This website! It was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an awesome static site generator to easily bring together a portfolio website and blog.

It's all open-source and hosted with GitHub Pages, so if you want to take a look at how I did it, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/ferdbold/ferdbold)!
