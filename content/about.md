Hi, I'm Frédéric Bolduc. I'm a game and front-end developer from the arctic wastelands of Quebec. I'm currently working full-time as a UI programmer at [Ubisoft Québec](https://quebec.ubisoft.com), but feel free to [send me a pigeon](mailto:me@ferdbold.com) if you want to talk.

I am also one of the founders of [Terra Arcana](http://terraarcana.com), nothing less than the most awesome LARP event in Quebec.
