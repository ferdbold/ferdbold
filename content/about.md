Hi, I’m Frédéric Bolduc. I’m a game and front-end developer from the arctic wastelands of Quebec. I’m currently working full-time as a UI programmer at Ubisoft Montreal, as well as a web developer for the Wikimedia Foundation, but feel free to send me a pigeon if you want to talk.

I am also one of the founders of Terra Arcana, nothing less than the most awesome LARP event in Quebec.
